# Data Structures and Algorithms

I created this semester 1 of 2025 for the COMP2123 course.
A lot of students are unable to problem solve, or unable to see the larger focus of the course, and so I made this document.
None of the questions I created/found have solutions, however in general they are rather easy.

I also added the assignment template I created for the course, some of the styling is stolen, however the template is simple in any regard.
I would note that there are changes I would make to the template to at least teach students the basics of how \LaTeX works, especially with regards to the pseudocode example, which doesn't show good example of pseudocode.
